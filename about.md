I am Thomas Zimmermann. I am the creator and maintainer of [picotm], the
system-level transaction manager. My professional interest is in
transactional, distributed, and operating systems; systems development;
and low-level programming.

### Professional

I offer professional support for picotm. If you are interested in training,
consulting, or anything else around picotm, please [reach out.][contact]

I have been around in FOSS for roughly 20 years and been programming mainly in
C and C++ since 2000. I have experience with the complete software stack, from
hardware emulation in QEMU to Linux drivers to system's programming, to
graphics programming with OpenGL and GTK+. I (re-)designed the low-level
communication and driver architecture of Firefox OS during my time at Mozilla.

I hold a University degree in Computer Science (_Diplom-Informatiker_,
comparable to M.Sc.).
