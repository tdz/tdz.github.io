I am Thomas Zimmermann. I am the creator and maintainer of picotm, the
system-level transaction manager. My professional interest is in
transactional, distributed, and operating systems; systems development;
and low-level programming;

### Professional

I offer professional support for picotm. If you are interested in training,
consulting, or anything else around picotm, please [reach out.][contact]

I have been around in FOSS for roughly 20 years and been programming mainly in
C and C++ since 2000. I have experience with the complete software stack, from
hardware emulation in QEMU to graphics programming with OpenGL and GTK+.
I (re-)designed the system architecture of Firefox OS during my time at
Mozilla.

I hold a University degree in Computer Science (_Diplom-Informatiker_,
comparable to M.Sc.).
