Just a quick _Thank you_ to everyone involved with Jekyll.

<!-- excerpt -->

Before I get to my own topics, I think it's appropriate that I thank everyone
who is involved with [Jekyll][jekyll] for their work. Jekyll is the CMS
software I'm using, and I could not have made this website and blog without
it.

A special _Thank you_ goes out to [Stijn][stijn], who's Jekyll theme
[Holo Alfa][holo_alfa] I'm using.
